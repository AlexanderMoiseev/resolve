# Lesson 1 - Create a New reSolve Application

You can create a new reSolve app using the create-resolve-app utility available on **npm**:

##### npm:

```sh
npm i -g create-resolve-app
create-resolve-app shopping-list
```

##### npx:

```sh
$ npx create-resolve-app shopping-list
```

##### yarn:

```sh
$ yarn create resolve-app shopping-list
```

After this a minimal reSolve application is ready. You can run it in development mode by typing:

```sh
$ yarn run dev
```
