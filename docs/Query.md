# Query

## What is a Query?

**Query** are used to get data from a Read Model and View Model. 

Refer to [DDD_Aggregates](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DDD_Aggregate.html) or [DDD, Event Sourcing, and CQRS Tutorial: design](http://cqrs.nu/tutorial/cs/01-design) for more information on aggregates.

## How to Use?

You can describe Queries for Read Model in commmon/read-models/resolvers.js file:

```
📁 resolve-app
    ...
    📁 common
        📁 read-models
            📄 resolvers.js
```

A typical Query structure:

```jsx
export default {
  user: async (store, { id, name }) => {
    const user =
      name != null
        ? await store.findOne('Users', { name })
        : id != null
          ? await store.findOne('Users', { id })
          : null

    return user
  }
}
```
