### Performance Improvements

* **resolve-storage-lite:** use nedb instead of simple file storage ([3ca48ba](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/commit/3ca48ba))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **resolve-storage-lite:** resolve-storage-memory and resolve-storage-file are replaced by resolve-storage-lite. This package supports two behaviors. Don't pass any arguments if you want to use it as in-memory storage and pass the path to the db file to use it as file storage.
