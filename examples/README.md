# Examples

## Installation

You can get a sample app using the `create-resolve-app` tool with the -e flag followed by an example name. Use the create-resolve-app -h command to list the available examples.

You can get a sample reSolve application using this command:

```bash
npx create-resolve-app todo-example -e todo
```

The created application is accessible using the http://localhost:3000/ and http://<your_ip>:3000 URLs (you can change your URL settings).

Instead of npx you can also use npm or yarn tools:

```bash
yarn create resolve-app todo-example -e todo
```
or

```bash
npm i -g create-resolve-app
create-resolve-app todo-example -e todo
```
